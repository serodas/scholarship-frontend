# Scholarship Frontend
The frontend project in angular consists of developing a web application that allows the best high school graduates from educational institutions to access a scholarship to continue their higher studies. The web application facilitates the application process, as it allows users to enter their personal, academic and socioeconomic data, as well as attach the documents required for evaluation. The web application also shows the status of the application and the results of the selection. The frontend project in angular 8.1.2 uses reusable components, services, directives, pipes and modules to create a dynamic, interactive and responsive user interface.

```

2. Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to build the containers for the first time. From now on, you just need to run `docker-compose up -d`.

3. You should work inside the container `app`. This project is configured to work with [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). So you can run the command `Reopen in container` after opening the project.

4. Enter http://localhost:4200/ according to configuration in docker-compose.ym
